## Background

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
A.I.Nemo, founded in 2014, is a Chinese hardware startup focused on AI technologies.<br>
Its leadership team includes former employees from Polycom, Microsoft, YY, Baidu, and UFIDA, and is backed by investors such as Innovation Works, Foxconn, Lightspeed China, and Chengwei Capital.<br>
Its two flagship products are the cloud-based video solution A.I.Nemo Office and the smart voice-controlled robot A.I.Nemo at Home. A.I.Nemo Office is applicable in telemedicine, online education, smart shopping, and video conferencing, while A.I.Nemo at Home is used for family communication.

## Challenges

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
As a startup, we urgently needed reliable and scalable compute resources, stable and affordable bandwidth, secure storage, static content delivery, and network protection.<br>
Given our industry’s high technical demands—especially for online broadcasting—we required infrastructure capable of serving users across China and globally with ultra-low latency and minimal packet loss.
</div>

## Why Alibaba Cloud

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
Before choosing Alibaba Cloud, we considered self-hosting, but as a small company, we couldn’t bear the high operations and scaling costs. We tested Alibaba Cloud along with Azure, Amazon, and QingCloud. What impressed us most was Alibaba Cloud's excellent performance under heavy traffic—minimizing latency and packet loss, which is mission-critical for our industry. Another key factor was Alibaba Cloud's full technology stack that helps startups lower technical barriers, allowing us to invest more in improving core services and user experience. Eventually, we migrated our entire infrastructure to Alibaba Cloud.
</div>

## Architecture

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
We started with just 10 virtual servers and scaled to over 200. We now use Alibaba Cloud products like ECS, Load Balancer, RDS, OSS, CDN, MaxCompute, Cloud Shield, and Cloud Monitor.<br>
All services are hosted on ECS, and we either scale vertically (upgrade) or horizontally (add servers). We use security zones for computing, media clusters to handle peak traffic (some billed by bandwidth, others pay-as-you-go), balancing cost and complexity.<br>
We use OSS for video/image storage and CDN to offload traffic for on-demand video. Load balancing ensures stability, and RDS simplifies database operations. MaxCompute analytics guide our product strategy.
</div>

## Results

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
After migrating to Alibaba Cloud, our IT infrastructure is “all in the cloud.” We no longer hire full-time O&M staff. Our testing proves Alibaba Cloud excels in bandwidth stability and packet loss rate, thanks to their global network. Compared to peers, Alibaba Cloud also has pricing advantages. With basic servers, we process 10 million service requests and over 10,000 video requests daily, plus countless live and recorded video calls.
</div>

## Summary

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
We sincerely recommend Alibaba Cloud. They offer a powerful platform with refined products and tech, integrated solutions to accelerate development, and reduce costs. Their experts are responsive and solution-oriented, meeting our needs.
