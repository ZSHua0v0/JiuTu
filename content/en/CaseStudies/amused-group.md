## Background

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%">
Amused Group is a cultural and creative industry company. It primarily operates in two areas: creative events and physical products. Amused Group owns four subsidiaries: Amused Style, Amused Life, Amused Art, and Amused Touch. Its ultimate goal is to become a cultural business empire rivaling Disney.

## Challenges

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%">
Our company originally relied on traditional hard drive storage. From 2014 to 2017, we operated on traditional infrastructure. We were familiar with the system and could diagnose issues like disk failures, but our limited storage capacity became a major bottleneck.<br/>
As the business grew, we, like others in the industry, made the key decision to migrate to the cloud. One major reason was the significant amount of mobile access. We needed a reliable solution that could offer flexible bandwidth to deliver content to our growing users and scale resources on demand. Migrating to the cloud also meant reducing costs in infrastructure, energy, and staffing. In summary, we recognized the cloud could enhance operational efficiency and asset utilization.

## Why Alibaba Cloud

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%">
After deciding to migrate to the cloud, we found Alibaba Cloud to be the right choice. It offers excellent reliability, advanced security products, and storage solutions, which is why we chose it. Additionally, its global infrastructure gave us opportunities to expand our business worldwide.

Even before becoming a customer, we were impressed by Alibaba Cloud's support team—and even more so afterward. They were available anytime to answer our pre-sales questions about configuration. Based on our experience, submitting support tickets through the console was easy, and we received timely responses from the Alibaba Cloud team.

## Results

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%">
Initially, we weren’t familiar with Alibaba Cloud’s ecosystem, and that made us hesitate. But we were quickly impressed by its global network and advanced security. We soon learned to use the simple and intuitive console, and the Alibaba Cloud team helped us overcome early challenges in configuration. We deployed in Shanghai (East China 1) and Beijing (North China 1).<br/>
By deploying on Alibaba Cloud, we solved our biggest issue—limited storage. The Alibaba Cloud CDN proved to be a critical hub for large-scale events. For our recent projects, we delivered interactive video + game experiences to users globally. Fast loading speed was key to success, and Alibaba Cloud’s CDN played a vital role in handling traffic surges. User feedback was extremely positive, and our services remained stable throughout.
