<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
Beijing Yunpai Technology is a mobile internet company focused on developing and operating mobile cloud technologies.

## Challenges

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
Yunpai operated tens of thousands of physical cloud phones in offline IDCs. As business grew, managing mobile board servers became more complex.<br>
Due to long hardware procurement cycles and high idle costs, on-premise data centers couldn’t meet demand spikes during events. Also, growing hardware requirements from new games couldn’t be met promptly.

## Why Alibaba Cloud

<div style="color: #333333;margin-bottom: 4%"> 
Alibaba Cloud provided an elastic cloud phone solution with unified open APIs and a centralized control panel, allowing batch creation, easy O&M, and efficient management.<br>
The elastic cloud phone supports fine-grained scaling, and the public cloud resource pool ensures capacity on demand—helping Yunpai reduce costs.<br>
For high-performance gaming, Alibaba Cloud deployed enterprise-grade GPU acceleration and streaming codec technologies—delivering over 100% performance improvement over physical board cards. Based on this, Yunpai launched new SKUs with better performance and competitiveness.
